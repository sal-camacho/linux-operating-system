Step 1: Search for error messages in a log file by using grep to filter and isolate lines containing the word "error." This method is essential for pinpointing authentication problems, system failures, or unauthorized access attempts.

analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~$ cd logs
analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/logs$ grep error server_logs.txt
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error   The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error   An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error   Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error   Unauthorized access

Step 2: Locate files with specific strings by using `ls` piped into `grep` to filter filenames based on patterns like "Q1" or "access." This method is particularly handy for reviewing user activity or tracking quarterly reports.

analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/logs$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/reports/users$ ls | grep Q1
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/reports/users$ ls | grep access
Q1_access.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt

Step 3: Search file contents using grep to look inside individual files for specific strings or usernames. It helps uncover user deletions, department affiliations, and employee data based on structured text entries.

analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/reports/users$ ls
Q1_access.txt         Q2_added_users.txt    Q3_deleted_users.txt
Q1_added_users.txt    Q2_deleted_users.txt  Q4_access.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt  Q3_access.txt         Q4_added_users.txt
Q2_access.txt         Q3_added_users.txt    Q4_deleted_users.txt
analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/reports/users$ grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt
1025         jhill     Sales
analyst@d251b87cb3b6:~/reports/users$ grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt
1151         sshah     Human Resources
1145         msosa     Human Resources

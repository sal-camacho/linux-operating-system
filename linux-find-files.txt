Step 1: Get the current directory information. Identifies the shell's starting location using pwd and confirms its structure by listing contents with ls. This establishes a baseline for navigation within the file system.

analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~$ pwd
/home/analyst
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~$ ls
logs  projects  reports  temp

Step 2: Change directory and list the subdirectories demonstrate the use of the cd command with both relative and absolute paths to navigate to the reports directory. The ls command is used to check which subdirectories are available for further exploration.

# Uses relative path from current location
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~$ cd reports
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports$

or

# Uses absolute path from root
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~$ cd /home/analyst/reports
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports$ ls
users

Step 3: Locate and read the contents of a file by navigating to the user's subdirectory and inspecting the Q1_added_users.txt file using the cat command.

# Uses absolute path for navigation
nalyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports/users$

or

# Uses relative path from /reports
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports$ cd users
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports/users$ ls
Q1_added_users.txt  Q1_deleted_users.txt

# Displays contents using relative path
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports/users$ cat Q1_added_users.txt
employee_id  username  department
1001         bmoreno   Marketing
1026         apatel    Human Resources
1041         cgriffin  Sales
1104         mreed     Information Technology
1177         aezra     Human Resources
1188         noshiro   Finance

or

# Displays contents using absolute path
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports/users$ cat /home/analyst/reports/users/Q1_added_users.txt
employee_id  username  department
1001         bmoreno   Marketing
1026         apatel    Human Resources
1041         cgriffin  Sales
1104         mreed     Information Technology
1177         aezra     Human Resources
1188         noshiro   Finance

Step 4: Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory and use the head command to read the first 10 lines of server_logs.txt. This helps reinforce the basics of reading logs and shows how to effectively filter command-line output.

analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/reports/users$ cd /home/analyst/logs
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/logs$ ls
server_logs.txt
analyst@0aff30a89bc1:~/logs$ head server_logs.txt

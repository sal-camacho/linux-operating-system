Step 1: Learn more about commands by using whatis to get a quick overview of a commandâ€™s purpose, then follow up with man to dive into the full documentation. This approach helps build a solid understanding of how commands work and the options they offer.

analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ whatis cat
cat (1)              - concatenate files and print on the standard output
analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ man cat

NAME
       cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

SYNOPSIS
       cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --number-nonblank
              number nonempty output lines, overrides -n

       -e     equivalent to -vE

       -E, --show-ends
              display $ at end of each line

       -n, --number
              number all output lines

       -s, --squeeze-blank
              suppress repeated empty output lines

       -u     (ignored)

       -v, --show-nonprinting
              use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES

analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ apropos -a first part file
head (1)             - output the first part of files

Step 2:  Check out the useradd command and open its manual page to learn how to create users and explore the available options. This helps ensure secure account setup and proper system configuration.

analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ man useradd                 
USERADD(8)                 System Management Commands                 USERADD(8)

NAME
       useradd - create a new user or update default new user information

SYNOPSIS
       useradd [options] LOGIN

       useradd -D

       useradd -D [options]

DESCRIPTION
       useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,
       administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.

       When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new
       user account using the values specified on the command line plus the
       default values from the system. Depending on command line options, the
       useradd command will update system files and may also create the new
       user's home directory and copy initial files.

       By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see -g, -N,
       -U, and USERGROUPS_ENAB).

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the useradd command are:

       --badname
           Allow names that do not conform to standards.

       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
           The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not
           specified.  BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define
           the home directory. If the -m option is not used, BASE_DIR must
           exist.

           If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory
           specified by the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd, or /home by
           default.

       -c, --comment COMMENT
           Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login,
           and is currently used as the field for the user's full name.

       -d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
           The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the
           user's login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to
           BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name. The directory
           HOME_DIR does not have to exist but will not be created if it is
           missing.

       -D, --defaults
           See below, the subsection "Changing the default values".

       -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
           The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is
           specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

           If not specified, useradd will use the default expiry date specified
           by the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string
           (no expiry) by default.

Step 3: Explore the rm and rmdir commands using whatis to compare their functions. This helps highlight their differences: rm is used to remove files or directories, while rmdir is specifically for removing empty directories.

analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ whatis rm
rm (1)               - remove files or directories
analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ whatis rmdir
rmdir (1)            - remove empty directories
rmdir (2)            - delete a directory

Step 4: Identify the correct command by using apropos with relevant keywords to find the appropriate tool for creating a new group. This confirms that the groupadd command is the right choice for the task.

analyst@0c11a1da3005:~$ apropos -a create new group
groupadd (8)         - create a new group

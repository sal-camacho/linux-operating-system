# Linux Operating System Portfolio

This repository contains system administration walkthroughs and security-focused exercises completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. Each file documents core Linux tasks and demonstrates how to manage users, control permissions, and navigate the command line securely.

Reports include file operations, access control, shell input/output, and user lifecycle managementâ€”all aligned with best practices for cybersecurity readiness.

## About This Repository

As a Security Analyst in training, Iâ€™ve applied foundational Linux skills to simulate real-world administrative tasks and security configurations. These walkthroughs demonstrate how I manage file systems, enforce least privilege, and troubleshoot using built-in help tools.

My work aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and documents activity across its five domains: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

This repo features:

- File and directory management using Bash
- Permission and ownership enforcement
- User and group account creation and deletion
- Shell input/output redirection and filtering
- Package installation and verification
- Command discovery using `man`, `whatis`, and `apropos`

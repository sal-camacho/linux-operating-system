Step 1: Create a new user by using the useradd command to set up their account and assign their primary group.

analyst@8394218b901e:~$ sudo useradd researcher9
analyst@8394218b901e:~$ sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9

or 

# You could alternatively use the following variation of useradd when creating the user to perform both steps at once
analyst@8394218b901e:~$ sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team
useradd: user 'researcher9' already exists

Step 2: Assign ownership of files or directories by using the chown command. This allows a user to gain ownership, granting them access and modification rights.

#This makes researcher9 the owner of project_r.txt, transferring control from the previous user.
analyst@8394218b901e:~$ sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt

Step 3: Add the user to a secondary group by using the usermod command with the -a -G options. This ensures the user is added to an additional group without overwriting their existing group memberships.

#This allows the user to access resources shared with the sales_team group.
analyst@8394218b901e:~$ sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9

Step 4: To delete a user, use the userdel command to remove their account. If a group was created specifically for them and is no longer needed, you can remove it using the groupdel command.

# If the user's group isnâ€™t their primary group, the groupdel command may succeed without affecting other users.
analyst@20023f6604ad:~$ sudo userdel researcher9
userdel: group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.
analyst@20023f6604ad:~$ sudo groupdel researcher9
